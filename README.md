# Electric-Vehicle-range-Prediction  
In this project our main aim is to predict the range of electric vehicle for different type of weather & road condition based on different input parameter.  

## Python Libraries used in this project  
Numpy  
Pandas  
Seaborn  
Matplotlib  
Sklearn  

## Machine Learning Model for Prediction of Range :  
as this is supervised Regression based machine learning problem so we will use supervised machine learning algorithms  

### Multiple Linear Regression  
### Decision Tree Regressor
### Random Forest Regressotr

## Data Set Info  
in this data there are 194 rows and 27 columns
